    "We model the problem by creating a bipartite graph, where we have two sets of nodes, voters and polling locations. The source has an edge of capacity 1 to all voters. We create an edge between a voter and a polling location if the voter is within r units of the polling location and the capacity at that location has not yet been reached, the capacity of this edge is also 1. Furthermore, each polling location node has an edge to the sink of cacacity C. In my algorithm, I loop over every voter at each polling location, ensuring that if an every voter has a chance to be assigned to each poll given that it meets the restraints of C and r.\n",

    " The resulting graph has the source connected to every voter node with capacity 1, voter nodes connected to polling location nodes with capacity 1, and polling location nodes connected to the sink with capacity C.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Ford-Fulkerson algorithm is then called on this graph, correctly returning the maximum flow. The maximum flow cam be interpreted as the number of voters that can be successfully assigned to polling locations. The reasoning is that let's assume there are k voters, if every voter can be assigned to a poll, then the graph will contain k capacity 1 edges between the voter nodes and the poll nodes, since during the construction of the graph no more than C voters are assigned to each poll, the bottleneck of this graph won't be the edges from the polls to the sink, but rather the k edges from the voters to the polls. If the maximum flow returned by the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm is equal to the number of voters (k), it means that every voter can be assigned to a polling location within r miles of their home, adhering to the constraint that no poll may exceed a capcity of C voters, and we return true. If not, we return false meaning the given constraints make it impossible for every voter to be assigned to a poll.\n",

    "From the max-flow min-cut theorem we know that the maximum s-t flow is equal to the capacity of the minimum cut. Therefore to reduce the maximum flow, we must remove edges that are part of the minimum cut. Since all the edges have capacity 1, it doesn't matter which order these edges are removed. Also, in the case that k is larger than the number of edges in the min-cut, removing all the edges will disconnect the graph and make the maximum-flow 0, in either case the max-flow is minimized. This algorithm uses Ford-Fulkerson, a well proven algorithm, to find the maximum flow and residual graph of G. It then identifies the edges in the min-cut by seeing the nodes reachable from s in the residual, nodes not reachable from s in the residual, and then finds all edges directly between these two sets that are fully saturated. By definition, these edges cross the cut. As stated above, by removing k of these edges from G (or until we cannot remove any more), we minimize tha maximum flow."
