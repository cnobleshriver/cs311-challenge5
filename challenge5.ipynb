    "We will prove this algorithm by showing how the problem is modeled as a maximum flow problem, and it is known that the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm correctly solves maximum flow problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "We model the problem by creating a bipartite graph, where we have two sets of nodes, voters and polling locations. We create an edge between a voter and a polling location if the voter is within r units of the polling location and the capacity at that location has not yet been reached. By following these two rules, and looping over every voter at each polling location, we can ensure that every voter will be assigned to a poll if it is possible given the constraints of the proble. The resulting graph therefore accurately represents the constraints of the problem.\n",

    "The Ford-Fulkerson algorithm correctly returns the maximum flow. The maximum flow cam be interpreted as the number of voters that can be assigned to polling locations. If the maximum flow returned by the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm is equal to the number of voters, it means that every voter can be assigned to a polling location within r miles of their home, adhering to the constraint that no poll may exceed a capcity of C voters, and we return true. If not, we return false meaning the given constraints make it impossible for every voter to be assigned to a poll.\n",
